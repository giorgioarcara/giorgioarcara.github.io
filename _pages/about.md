I am an Associate Professor of Psychometrics at the University of Padova and member of the **Quantative Psychology Lab**.

I am also senior researcher of the **ONDA Lab** (**O**pen methodologies for **N**eurorehabilitation and **D**ata **A**nalysis) at San Camillo Hospital IRCCS in Venice. 
My main research interest is the application and development of advanced methods to neurophysiology, clinical neuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience. I'm also a passionate supporter of Open Science initiatives.
