In the spirit of Open Science, I'm uploading all my scripts (even scratches, or uneferenced code) in my github account.
Check out [https://github.com/giorgioarcara/](https://github.com/giorgioarcara/)

Over the years I developed the following packages:

- **`erpR`** is an R package for ERP (Event Related Potentials) analysis in R. The package is a bit outdatated and I plan to rewrite it, but include some useful functions to be used in `R` (e.g. for topoplots). Please find additional information about eprR on the [dedicated page](/erpr)

- **`gondola`** is a Matlab toolbox to facilitate brain network analysis. Please find details on [https://github.com/giorgioarcara/Gondola](https://github.com/giorgioarcara/Gondola)
