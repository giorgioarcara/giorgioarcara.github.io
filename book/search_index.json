If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) ## Warning: &#39;xfun::attr()&#39; is deprecated. ## Use &#39;xfun::attr2()&#39; instead. ## See help(&quot;Deprecated&quot;) ## Warning: &#39;xfun::attr()&#39; is deprecated. ## Use &#39;xfun::attr2()&#39; instead. ## See help(&quot;Deprecated&quot;) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2025) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). 2.1 Interactive Shiny App Below is a live Shiny app you can interact with directly in the book: 2.2 Interactive Plot with manipulateWidget This example shows how to use manipulateWidget to add sliders to a plot inside a Bookdown page. library(manipulateWidget) library(htmlwidgets) manipulateWidget( hist(rnorm(n, mean = m), col = &quot;skyblue&quot;, border = &quot;white&quot;, main = paste(&quot;Histogram (n =&quot;, n, &quot;, mean =&quot;, m, &quot;)&quot;)), n = mwSlider(10, 1000, value = 100, step = 10, label = &quot;Sample size&quot;), m = mwSlider(-5, 5, value = 0, step = 0.1, label = &quot;Mean&quot;) ) 2.3 Plotly example library(plotly) library(ggplot2) data(mtcars) p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = factor(cyl))) + geom_point() + labs(title = &quot;MPG vs. HP by Cylinders&quot;, x = &quot;Miles Per Gallon&quot;, y = &quot;Horsepower&quot;) # Convert ggplot to plotly ggplotly(p) References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
